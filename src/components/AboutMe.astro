      Hi! I'm Josué Rivas, a passionate <strong>fullstack</strong> developer currently
      focused on <strong>backend</strong>. I love building software modules that
      integrate both frontend and backend, optimizing the performance of each
      project.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to my work in development, I enjoy being part of the tech
      community and collaborating on initiatives that drive innovation and
      shared learning. I'm always looking to contribute and learn in every
      project.
